# Card-Generator
Generates a series of cards for practicing with.  They have a random background color with randomized text in two colors.  May require some fonts, I'll get them later.  It requires Spacy, Pillow, and a couple of text documents.  As written, it uses three public domain books which are in the repository.

I had made a bunch of cards like this last year to practice with Spacy.  Recently I wanted to make a program that reads text in images.


But then I was trying to rename them, and managed to delete every one.  The code I had used before was lost, so I wrote a new version of the program here.  Because the intention is to practice getting text details, I made them more complicated.  OpenCV has a hard time with white text on any background, and the different fonts might make it more difficult too.
